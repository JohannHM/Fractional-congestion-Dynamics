# Fractional-Congestion-Dynamics
Here the Matlab code for reproducing the fractional congestion SI model.
It is composed of an script to run the fractional congestion SI model and an aunxiliary .m file that perform the fractional Caputo's derivative.
The code here deposited is cardinal for reproducing results of The world-wide web waste.
